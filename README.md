  ## Description:
  The motivation behind this project was to create a blog website that can login and out. Only create posts while logged. Be able to see all current posts if logged in or not.  This project helped to teach me handlebars and creating all the files necessary to run a blog like this. This solves the need to create a blog. I learned how to store the data through models, creating a database server, controllers, seeding, frontend JS and handlebars views.
